### **Slide 2: Key Risks of AI Integration in Nuclear Operations**

🔹 **Algorithmic Bias & Misclassification**  
→ AI models trained on incomplete or biased data may misinterpret sensor readings or operational anomalies.

🔹 **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**  
→ AI systems can become attack vectors; adversarial inputs or model poisoning may compromise reactor safety.

🔹 **Lack of Explainability (Black Box Problem)**  
→ Critical decisions made by AI may not be auditable or interpretable by human operators or regulators.

🔹 **Human-AI Misalignment & Overreliance**  
→ Operators may defer to AI decisions without critical thinking, reducing situational awareness.

🔹 **Regulatory Lag & Standards Gaps**  
→ Existing nuclear safety frameworks were not designed for AI; global regulatory harmonization is lacking.

### **Slide 3: Recommended Regulatory & Operational Actions**

| Action Category         | Specific Action                                                                 | Responsible Entity          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Policy & Standards**  | Develop AI-specific safety guidelines (e.g., IAEA AI in Nuclear Safety Framework)| IAEA, NRC, CNSA, etc.       |
| **Technology Oversight**| Mandate explainability & auditability requirements for AI in nuclear systems     | NRC, ENSREG, national regulators |
| **Cybersecurity**       | Integrate AI security protocols (e.g., adversarial training, model watermarking) | NIST, IAEA Cybersecurity Group |
| **Training & Culture**  | Mandate AI literacy & human-in-the-loop training for nuclear operators           | Training institutions, utilities |
| **Incident Reporting**  | Establish AI-related incident reporting channels (AI failure logs, bias audits)  | IAEA, national nuclear safety bodies |

### **Slide 5: Closing Slide — Rationale**

> **“Proactive regulation balances innovation with safety in high-stakes nuclear environments.”**

*Why this matters:*  
Nuclear energy demands the highest safety standards. AI offers unprecedented efficiency and predictive capabilities — but only if deployed responsibly. Proactive, globally coordinated regulation ensures that innovation does not outpace oversight, preserving public trust and operational integrity.

*Next Steps:*  
- Finalize global AI safety standards by end of 2025  
- Scale pilot audits to 10+ nuclear sites by 2026  
- Foster public-private partnerships for AI safety R&D

**Design Notes for Visual Presentation:**  
- Use nuclear blue/grey color palette for professionalism and safety association  
- Icons: ⚙️ for regulation, 🤖 for AI, 📅 for timeline, 📊 for data  
- Font: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Open Sans)  
- Slide transitions: Minimal, professional, with subtle nuclear energy imagery (e.g., reactor core silhouette, AI neural net overlay)
