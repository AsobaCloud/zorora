**Policy Brief: AI Integration in Nuclear Energy Operations**  
*For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and Department of Energy (DOE)*  

---

**Key Risks of AI Integration in Nuclear Energy Systems**  
1. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: AI systems can be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate control algorithms, leading to operational failures or safety breaches.  
2. **Algorithmic Bias & Model Drift**: Biased training data may result in unfair decision-making (e.g., reactor shutdowns), while model drift could reduce system reliability over time.  
3. **Human Reliance Reduction**: Over-reliance on AI may diminish human expertise, complicating emergency response or maintenance tasks.  
4. **Data Quality & Integrity**: Poor-quality input data can propagate errors in AI models, undermining safety-critical decisions.

**Recommended Regulatory Actions**  
1. **AI Explainability Standards**: Mandate interpretability of AI models used in reactor control systems to ensure operators understand and trust automated decisions.  
2. **Human-in-the-Loop Protocols**: Require real-time human oversight for high-risk operations (e.g., fuel handling, emergency shutdowns) to maintain accountability.  
3. **Bias & Fairness Audits**: Establish requirements for periodic audits of AI training datasets and model performance across diverse operating conditions.  
4. **Incident Response Frameworks**: Develop guidelines for rapid detection and containment of AI-related anomalies or cyberattacks in nuclear facilities.

**Call to Action for 2025**  
- **By January 1, 2025**, finalize and publish regulatory sandboxes for testing AI systems in controlled nuclear environments.  
- **By Q2 2025**, mandate that all new AI deployments undergo third-party validation of cybersecurity resilience and bias mitigation.  
- **By December 31, 2025**, require DOE to collaborate with NRC on a joint AI risk assessment framework tailored to nuclear infrastructure.  

**Rationale**: Proactive regulation will safeguard public health and the environment while fostering innovation in advanced nuclear technologies.
